# Why Settlegration?
Founded in Waterloo, Ontario Canada in 2018, Settlegration is an app that helps Canadian newcomers settle more smoothly in Canada through volunteer-based services.

1. Current transitional services from the Canadian government do not satisfy all basic needs of Canadian newcomers.
2. Upon arrival, newcomers in Canada don't feel as connected with their community. Settlegration makes this process smooth by connecting newcomers with volunteers on the app.
3. In helping newcomers through Settlegration's services, volunteers will be able to meet new friends and gain volunteer hours along the way.
